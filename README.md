+ **[2023.03]** The official code of TVTS has been released.
+ **[2023.05]** ðŸš€ TVTSv2 is comming out! Please refer to [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14173) for details. 

## Introduction

### Quickstart

Folder [v1](v1) contains the official code of TVTS. See [v1-README](v1/README.md) for details.

Folder [v2](v2) contains the official code of TVTSv2, an upgraded version of TVTS that produces powerful video representations for *out-of-the-box* usage. See [v2-README](v2/README.md) for details.
